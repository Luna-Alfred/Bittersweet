    <p>Look here,it's just gibberish actually or the fact <em>I do not want to talk about it</em></p>
    <h2>
        Could be a regret?</h2>
        <p>Dark house, by which once more I stand,here in the long unlovely street,doors, where my heart was used to beatSo quickly, waiting for a hand,  
            A hand that can be clasp’d no more—Behold me, for I cannot sleep,and like a guilty thing I creep at earliest morning to the door …</p>
    <h3>Perharps it's better?</h3>
    <p>Because I liked you better than suits a man to say,It irked you, and I promised To throw the thought away.To put the world between us
        We parted, stiff and dry;
        ‘Good-bye,’ said you, ‘forget me.’‘I will, no fear’, said I.....Seventeen years ago you said something that sounded like good-bye;
        And everybody thinks that you are dead,but I. So I, as I grow stiff and cold to this and that say good-bye too;</p>
    <h4>It should be fear,you say?</h4>
    <p> Maybe it's that I couldn't get over the fact that you abandoned me,left me behind...So, I grew cold, not wanting it to ever happen to me again.
        You can call it fear all you want but I would say it's been cautious.</p></p>
